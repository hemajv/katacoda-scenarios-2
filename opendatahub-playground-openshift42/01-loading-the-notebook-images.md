### OpenDataHub Operator

Open Data Hub is a blueprint for building an AI as a service platform on Red Hat's Kubernetes-based OpenShiftÂ® Container Platform and Ceph Object Storage. It inherits from upstream efforts such as Kafka/Strimzi and Kubeflow, and is the foundation for Red Hat's internal data science and AI platform.
